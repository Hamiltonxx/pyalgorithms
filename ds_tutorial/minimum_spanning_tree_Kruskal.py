# Minimum Spanning Tree
# A spanning tree of connected undirected graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects 
# all the vertices together.
# A minimum spanning tree for a weighted,connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree
# with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.

# Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
#1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
#2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
#3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
